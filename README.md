# mental-health-CV
Using frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js and Tailwind CSS), I created and developed an easy-to-use questionnaire to evaluate mental health. I used logic integration to assess user feedback and provide tailored suggestions for tools or self-care routines. My main goals were to improve user experience through the development of unambiguous question formats, quick response times, and accessibility features. This strategy made sure that the questionnaire was not only useful and visually appealing but also inclusive and educational, providing users with personalized guidance to enhance their mental health.
